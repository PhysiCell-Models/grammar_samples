Many people have contributed to PhysiCell Studio. 
Dr. Paul Macklin created PhysiCell and
continues to oversee its development. He has also been a regular tester of the Studio and his feedback 
has had pretty high priority :-)

Randy Heiland, Research Associate in the Macklin Lab, has been the lead designer and developer of the Studio.

Vincent Noel, Institut Curie, designed and developed the Boolean tab in the Intracellular subtab of Cell Types.
