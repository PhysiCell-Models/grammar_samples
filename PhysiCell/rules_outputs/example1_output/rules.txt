Cell Hypothesis Rules

In tumor cells:
oxygen increases cycle entry
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen decreases necrosis
oxygen decreases transform to motile tumor

In motile tumor cells:
oxygen increases cycle entry
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen decreases necrosis
oxygen increases transform to tumor
